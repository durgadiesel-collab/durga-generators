About Generators,
An electric generator is a device that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy, operating on the principle of electromagnetic induction. It doesn't create energy but rather changes it from one form to another, with the mechanical force coming from sources like internal combustion engines, wind turbines, or steam turbines.
#How it works
Most electromagnetic generators have two main components: a rotor and a stator. The basic process involves: 
Mechanical motion: A source of mechanical power (like a turbine or engine) causes a shaft to spin.
Magnetic field: This rotating shaft, or rotor, has magnets attached to it that create a moving magnetic field.
Inducing current: The rotor spins within a stationary ring of wire coils called the stator. As the magnetic field from the rotor moves past the coils in the stator, it induces a flow of electric current in the wire.
Electrical output: This current is then directed to an external circuit to provide power.
